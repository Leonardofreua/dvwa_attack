[LOW]
Either Name or Message field allows script injection:

<script>alert("1");</script>

Obs.: There isn`t character limit validation on backend (only in HTML). So,
if we remove the maxlength value and we can send any payload containing a script.

[MEDIUM]
The validation of the Name field is not testing the case sensitive of the script tag:

Obs.: Still no character limit validation on backend.

<SCRIPT>alert(1)</SCRIPT>

[HIGH]
The Name field is allowing HTML events:

<img src=x onerror="alert('1')"/>
